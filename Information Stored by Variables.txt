local energy changes
agents, number of different regions (limit is 1000), range, 
1 = x upper bound
2 - x lower bound
3 - y upper bound
4 - y lower bound
5 - z upper bound
6 - z lower bound
7 - energy change per tick
0 - whether or not a local energy is specified for the agent

localized agent production
1 - x distance
2 - y distance
3 - z distance

agentreservoir
1 - capacity
2 - actual level
0 - whether or not there is a reservoir for that agent

How to set up interactions to use the reservoir feature:
Agent X interacts with Agent Y and diminishes
Agent X is the agent that is supposed to disappear
Agent Y is the static agent with the reservoir

staticagentid - the types of agents that are static
2 - the agent is static
0 - the agent is not static 

reservoiragentid
2 - reservoir
0 - no reservoir
(1 - agent type, 2 - capacity)

reservoiragentreleased
agent type (static agent type), agent type released
1 - number of agents released per tick
2 - reservoir change per agent released
3 - x distance
4 - y distance
5 - z distance
6 - first agent in interaction
7 - second agent in interaction

1 - x transfer
2 - y transfer
9 - agent that is the buyer
10 - agent that is the seller
5) = x
exchange
1 - whether or not an item is being exchanged (2 - eing exchanged, 0 - inactive)
2 - Initial quantity for 1st agent
3 - number of items being transferred
4 - transfer of currency
5 - initial quantity for 2nd agent
6 - utility function for that product
7 - a (constant)
8 - b (constant)

agentproduct
1 - quantity of product
2 - utility for product

(multiple products, but single utility function for all products. each product has its own utility function)
